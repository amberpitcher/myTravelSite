				<h2>GOLDEN HILL, SAN DIEGO</h2>
				<p><br>By now the lure of the Pacific will probably be pretty intense, and we have just the thing...

				Fast, fun, and just a little bit fancy, who doesn't love cruising on the ocean and riding white water on a speed boat? Run by possibly the most quintessentially Californian dudes you'll ever meet, hop on board at the marina and as you cruise out, eye up the millionaires yachts for when you make your fortune.

				Once out in the bay, it's throttle up as you do a big old loop to the Coronado Bridge and back. On route, you'll pass huge navy ships that will make you feel teeny tiny, and the absolute highlight of the trip - you'll get up close to the docks where San Diego's most beloved residents hang out. Who are they? Sea lions!</p>

				<p><br>Just 13 miles south of downtown San Diego, you'll find Suzie's Farm, a 70-acre organic working farm that grows over 100 varieties of seasonal veggies, herbs, flowers and fruits, year round.

				Pretty as a picture, Suzie's Farm is also where Hilary homes her bees, offering group hive tours once a month. What does this entail? Well, after suiting up in your bee suit, Hilary will lead you to the heart of the beehive, where thousands of busy buzzing bees are working hard to produce delicious honey.

				BUT don't 'bee' confused; Hilary's tour isn't about learning to 'bee' a beekeeper, it is focused more on bee welfare, the various uses for honey, and how you can help these little unsung heros out in your own backyard.</p>
